# PFRPG Disease Tracker
After completing my sanity tracker, I realized that it would be a fairly easy task to fork it into a disease and poison tracker,.
Just like the sanity tracker, there is a list of afflictions. Each opens to a statblock with space for everything in a typical statblock of this type from Paizo.
When the statblock is locked, a button will be shown to roll a saving throw against the affliction.
