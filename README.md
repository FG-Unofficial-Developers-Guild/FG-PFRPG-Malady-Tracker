# PFRPG Disease Tracker
After completing my sanity tracker, I realized that it would be a fairly easy task to fork it into a disease and poison tracker,.
Just like the sanity tracker, there is a list of afflictions. Each opens to a statblock with space for everything in a typical statblock of this type from Paizo.
When the statblock is locked, a button will be shown to roll a saving throw against the affliction. If ClockAdjuster is enabled, saves can be rolled automatically.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Classic](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsClassic.php) 3.3.11 and [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.0.0 (2020-08-05). If you're using the ClockAdjuster extension with FG Classic, please be aware that timed events (such as automatic saves) will not occur precisely. For example, a 1/day save seems to take 25-26hours to occur.

# Features
* Track diseases or poisons that are incurred
* If poison, show buttons to increaes DC or duration (for subsequent doses/exposure)
* Manual button to roll against listed save DC and announce success/failure
* Automated rolling of saving throws based on elapased time. This requires pr6i6e6st's [Clock Adjuster](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?57561-Utility-Clock-Adjuster) extension.
* Automatic counting of rolled saves (automatic or manual), taking into account consecutive/nonconsecutive requirements.
